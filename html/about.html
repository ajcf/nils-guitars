					In 2009, I started working in a lutherie as an after school job. My job was started out with a focus on basic shop organization and restringing but quickly I moved on to do repairs and general maintenance of sorts on all kinds of fretted instruments. After about a year of doing repairs, I ended up building my first instrument under the guidance of Owen Davidson in his shop at Downtown Sounds in Northampton, Massachusetts. Having been introduced to the basics concepts and fundamentals of construction, I found myself fascinated with the design and construction of guitars and mandolins. Very quickly, I ended up perusing my line of quality musical instruments, built on sound design principals, with the hope of creating something beautiful and intuitive with the potential to last a lifetime and allow musicians of all kinds to express themselves.

				<h3>Vision</h3>
				<p>
					As a musician, there is something about having the right instrument that can make all the difference. But what makes an instrument the <i>right</i> one? There are a lot of ways that one might choose to answer this, but for me, I choose a simple answer. The right instrument simply feels right; when you're playing it, you can't always put words to it. With this instrument, you're able to focus on the music. The tone  fits what you're trying to convey and the feel leaves you not wanting. As a luthier, my ultimate goal is to provide musicians with instruments that they love and cherish. I want you're guitar to be the right one, for you.

			<h3>Design and Craftsmanship </h3>

					My number one priority as a luthier is the design and craftsmanship of my instruments. The combined tension from the strings on the bridge of a guitar is around 180lbs. This means that the design of a guitar has to be good if the guitar is to have longevity! My designs all prioritize both sound projection and structural integrity. To do this, I build the instruments strong where they need to be and lightly where they need to resonate. I believe that producing the best instruments I can is the best way to ensure that my instruments will be played and enjoyed for their lifetimes, while appreciating in value.
