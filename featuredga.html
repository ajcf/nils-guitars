						Of all the guitars that I build, this one is potentially the most versatile design that I offer. With with a Sitka spruce top and mahogany back and sides, this guitar's responsiveness, liveliness and overall robust sound lend themselves nicely to many styles of playing.  
					</p>

						High grade sitka spruce is quite stiff yet very lightweight. It's density is less than that of Adirondack spruce and in turn it tends to produce thicker mid-tones. I would definitely say that Adirondack spruce is my first choice of wood for an instrument in which low end capability is key, but the rich and even tone of sitka is also something to be desired. With the qualities of sitka spruce in mind, this guitar's mahogany back and sides really push this instrument's top to excel where it naturally wants to. Mahogany produces a mellow and full sound. The reason it sounds this way is because in addition to focusing sound through the soundboard, sound also tends to be dispersed in other directions as well. The combination of a rich and even sounding top with mellow sounding back and sides create a strong and warm resonance. It's a tone that will fill the room, but isn't overpowering. It's also a tone that will sustain, even with gentle playing. It can also be driven hard without losing clarity. This guitar is definitely one that I would recommend to be an all around workhorse for players who want something that will work well for a number or styles.
