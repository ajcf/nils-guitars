					Caring For Your Instrument
				</h1>
				<hr>

				<p>
					With proper care, your acoustic instrument should last a long time and be relatively maintenance free for its lifetime, apart from setups, occasional fretwork and routine cleaning. Without proper care, there are a lot of things that can go wrong and expensive repairs will be necessary.  
				</p>


				<h3 class="titles">
					Humidity and Temperature
				</h3>
				<p>
					When I build any instrument,  my goal is to have the humidity as close to 50% as possible through-out the entire process. I choose 50% because in New England, winters are dry since we have to heat our houses and summers can be very humid because, it's New England. Building at 50% humidity allows the finished instrument's wood to contract or expand a fair amount without causing damage. If an instrument is built in a very dry environment, it won't handle a damp environment well and will actually start to appear puffed out when exposed to moisture. If an instrument is built in a very damp environment, it won't handle dry environment well, and will probably crack. 
				</p>	

				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Use a humidifier if your instrument is in a dry place. Your heater will dry out the air in your house, so if your heat it turned on, you should make sure your instrument stays in its case with a 	humidifier. (Unless, of course, your playing it:))
						</li>	

						<li> 
							Avoid exposing your instrument to prolonged periods of high humidity. This means that you 	shouldn&#8217t store your instrument in a damp basement. This also means that if you live in a region with a particularly wet season, you should consider keeping your guitar in an air conditioned 	environment. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>	
				<p>	
					Generally speaking, too much humidity only becomes a problem in extreme situations and you shouldn't worry about your it too much. Dryness, on the other hand is a more serious issue and prevalent issue.  Fear not though. Humidifiers are inexpensive, readily available and easy to use. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					Lacquer finish can check (small cracks and crazing) if exposed to a drastic change in temperature. This is particularly common to see if and instrument rapidly goes from a cold environment to a warm environment. Should your instrument become cold, keep it in it's case to let it slowly return to room temperature. An instrument with an oil finish shouldn’t check, but you still shouldn’t let it get cold and you should still let it gradually warm up to ensure minimal movement of the top and back. 
				</p>	

				<h3 class="titles">
					Fretboard Care
				</h3>
				<p>	
					There are two components to fretboard care. Cleaning and conditioning. Cleaning should be done as needed and conditioning should be done sparingly. 
				</p>	

				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>
							To clean off a mildly dirty fretboard, simply rub off grime/buildup/etc. using a paper towel 	moistened with water.)
						</li>	

						<li> 
							If there is a fair amount of grime build up, you can use a soft bristle brush (a tooth brush works 	great) and some ammonia based cleaner such as Windex. It's fine to get the fretboard 	saturated with an ammonia based cleaner, but don't let it soak in deeply. After scrubbing off the 	grime, 	promptly dry off with paper towel.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					To condition your instrument's fretboard, use mineral oil. Mineral oil is what I recommend because it won't contaminate the wood if applied appropriately, will not leave behind a film, is non-toxic, and will provide a reasonable amount of protection.  Contrary to popular belief, your instrument's fretboard doesn't actually need to be conditioned. If you over-do it, you can actually do more harm than good. With this in mind, conditioning your fretboard is something you might wish to do for two reasons. The first is that is that a conditioned fingerboard looks really nice. The second is that it will provide some protection against slight environmental changes and possible contaminates on your fingers.  
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Prior to conditioning your fretboard, you should clean it. 
						</li>	

						<li> 
							To condition, simply apply a thin coat of oil across the board and promptly wipe off as much 	excess as possible.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>	
				<p>
					The more times you have oiled your fretboard, the fewer times you do it in the future. I recommend conditioning your fretboard no more than once a year for the first couple of years, and even less as the instrument ages. As stated previously, your fingerboard actually doesn’t need anything to applied to it. Not oiling your fretboard will not cause the wood to become brittle and chip, nor will it cause the frets to become loose. Over-oiling your fretboard, on the other hand, will potentially cause the wood to soften which may loosen the frets. Too much will also potentially cause problems should you ever need to have your guitar re-fretted, as glue will not adhere as well to the fretboard.  
				</p>

				<p>
					If your fret edges feel sharp and are sticking over the edge of the fretboard, it's a symptom of dryness. In this situation, the best thing to do is to put the guitar in a case with a humidifier. This will hopefully fix the problem. Unfortunately, I've found that for some reason the frets never really become flush with the edge of the fretboard again. If this is the case, you should take your guitar to a luthier to have the fret edges filed.

					Cleaning and Polishing
				</h3>
				<p>
					To clean your guitar's finish, use <a href="http://www.stewmac.com/Materials_and_Supplies/Cleaners_and_Lubricants/Preservation_Polish.html">Preservation Polish</a> from Stewart MacDonald. I've tried a handful of different cleaners, and this stuff is not only one of the safest for your instrument, but it also works the best. Use it with a cotton rag to remove fingerprints, general dirt, or whatever it is that you get on your instrument. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If your guitar's finish requires more attention than the Preservation Polish, consider taking it to a professional luthier. It's very easy make a minor cosmetic problem a major one if you over-do it with polishing compounds.
